@section Graphical user interface
  The graphical user interface, or GUI can display and export an Inkling sketch
  with custom settings applied to it. In the image below the top bar of the GUI
  is further explained.

  @noindent Using the @emph{File} menu you can open a WPI file and later export
  it to another format. Clicking on a colored button will open a dialog to change
  that color. You can disable the pen pressure completely by switching the 
  @emph{Pen pressure} switch to @code{OFF}. Turning on the @emph{Zoom level} 
  allows you to zoom in and out the document.
  
@subsection Limitations
  The GUI is not capable of doing all tasks that can possibly be done with 
  InklingReader. One of those limitations is merging WPI files 
  (@xref{merging,,Merging WPI files}).@*

  Another limitation is setting a transparent color. You can set this using a 
  command-line option or using a configuration file, but unfortunately, you 
  cannnot set transparent colors using the GUI itself.
