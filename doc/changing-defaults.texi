@section Changing the default options
  You can adjust most of the settings you can change on the command-line using a
  configuration file. InklingReader follows the XDG user directory 
  specification, so the location InklingReader looks for this configuration
  file may differ. On GNU/Linux this will most likely be 
  @file{$HOME/.config/inklingreaderrc}.@*
  @*
  Most settings can be applied in much the same way as their command-line
  examples. The contents of a complete configuration file is given below.

@example
@emph{# When a line starts with a # it will be treated as a comment.}
background = #eee
colors = #00007c,black,#007c00,#7c0000
pressure-factor = 1.35

@emph{# You may also use a preset like A4 or US Letter.}
dimensions = 210x297mm

@emph{# The orientation can be either Portrait or Landscape.}
orientation = Portrait
