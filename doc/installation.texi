@section GNU/Linux
  Installing InklingReader involves compiling the source code. Fortunately,
  this has been made pretty easy. 

@subsection Dependencies
  First, you need to make sure you have the following tools and development 
  libraries installed:
  @itemize
    @item GCC or CLANG (preferably GCC)
    @item Automake
    @item Autoconf
    @item Make
    @item Gtk+-3.0, GLib-2.0 and Cairo
    @item Librsvg-2.0
  @end itemize

@subsection Compiling and installing
  Once you've resolved the dependencies you will be able to compile the source
  code by running the following commands from the project's root directory:
@noindent @example
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
make install
@end example
@*
  @noindent Please note: To run @code{make install} succesfully you may need super 
  user privileges.
